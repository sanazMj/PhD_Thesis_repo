This repository contains the code for the first chapter of my PhD thesis, called "Novel Generative Adversarial Network Architectures for Generating Discrete Image Data".
This repository contains the codes for the following publication:

Mohammadjafari, S., Ozyegen, O., Cevik, M., Kavurmacioglu, E., Ethier, J. and Basar, A., 2021. Designing mm-wave electromagnetic engineered surfaces using generative adversarial networks. Neural Computing and Applications, 33(17), pp.11309-11323.

# Repository structure
There are two folders available, each containing the codes for different datasets. 

[MNIST experiments](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_GAN_EES/tree/main/MNIST%20experiments) folder contains .ipynb files for sample models (Vanilla GAN, Conditional GAN, Convolutional GAN, Conditional Convolutional GAN).

[EES experiments](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_GAN_EES/tree/main/EES%20experiments) folder contains files on EES training for 9x9 and 19x19 designs.
