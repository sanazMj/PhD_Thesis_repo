This repository contains the code for the third chapter of my PhD thesis, called "Novel Generative Adversarial Network Architectures for Generating Discrete Image Data".
This repository contains the codes for the following study which is under review:

Mohammadjafari, S., Cevik, M. \& Basar, A. Improved $\alpha$-GAN architecture for generating 3D connected volumes with an application to radiosurgery treatment planning, Applied Intelligence (2022).
# Repository structure

There are two folders available.

[GAN experiments](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_3D_tumorGAN/tree/main/GAN%20experiments) folder contains baseline GANs and AlphaWGAN experiments.

[Synthetic data generation](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_3D_tumorGAN/tree/main/Synthetic%20data%20generation) folder contains files on generating synthetic data for the paper. 

# Steps
* Use files in Synthetic data generation folder to create the synthetic data.
* Use GAN\AlphaWGAN experiments to run the models.
